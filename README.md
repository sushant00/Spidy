# Spidy
Wall Climbing Robot using Raspberry Pi
<br><br><br>
## Abstract
This project aims at designing and developing a mini robot that can climb (crawl) walls and ceilings and can be operated remotely using the latest RF technology. The robot will be equipped with a 360 degree view camera to provide a real time video stream, taking spying to the next level and to make the remote operation easy. 
<br><br>
Microcontrollers will be used for main operations. The operator on the transmitting end will be provided with a transmitter (may be a simple remote or an android application) with such a user interface that suits both beginners and experts. 
<br><br>
This kind of robot promises a wide range of applications, some of which include security, cleaning and transportation. The robust design accepts additional features and modifications so as to enhance the current operation or to perform new and challenging tasks.

## Introduction
The trend of mini robots equipped with cams and certain other functionalities has been rising recently, with most of them focusing on more or less only one function, and that is spying. While there have been many successful inventions on this particular idea, most of them lack the ability to climb. So we would like to take the idea of spy robot to another level.  No matter how technologically advanced the robot is, it can’t be used to its full potential until it can span every possible terrain. Although there are some robots capable of climbing walls, but still they are too less in number and lack some of the important functionalities. The use of these robots are not limited to a single field, instead, they can be used in almost every condition where it is too difficult for a human to reach. 
 <br><br>
While our main focus is to implement wall climbing as efficiently as we can, we would then add other features to the robot to perform various other tasks which we have mentioned in the report later. 
 <br><br>
The main point that needs to be kept in mind is that it can neither be too heavy nor too light as heavier robots can easily slip off the track while lighter ones won’t be able to survive rough conditions. 
 <br><br>
The robots that have been built in the past had limited usage/functions but the one that we have thought of would implement various functionalities. Some of them include sending a live feed of the surrounding to a dedicated screen and according to the conditions; the person in charge may take necessary steps. So in this way a single design can help to further build similar robots with varying functions. 
 <br><br>
According to U.S. Census Bureau robots will take over 5 million jobs, most of which include the ones in hostile environments where survival is tough. So in order to fulfil the demand, robots need to be built taking all the aforementioned points in consideration.

 ## Application
 **1) Spying:** With the increasing tension on borders, there has been a sudden demand for technologically advanced machines that can help us counter every move of enemies and one of the most effective way to do so is by knowing each and every step of the rival, and this is exactly the situation where spy bots come in handy. Recently there have been inventions of night spying robots. 
 <br>
**2) Cleaning purpose:** We are aware of the fact that number skyscrapers are being constructed around the globe and humans have been employed to clean off the dust from windows high above the ground. So these robots can take place of human thereby increasing productivity and at the same time eliminating any possibility of accidents. 
 <br>
**3) Testing:** These kinds of robots can be used for performing non-destructive tests in the industry. 
 <br>
**4) Civil construction:** Recently, there have been many accidents at the construction sites and some of them even resulting in loss of lives; so the robot can be used at construction sites for repair and maintenance, like checking for strength and cracks in walls of nuclear reactors etc. 
 <br>
**5) Transportation:** Due to its durable and withstanding structure, the robot can be used for transportation of loads inside buildings or factories.
